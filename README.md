# Datasets

These are unverified datasets we were able to obtain from OpenStreetMap and other data sources. Spatial Collective is working on verifying some of the data sets. They are available in csv format and contain a coordinates column (WKT Geometry).

Simply press the download button to get the data sets, and you can get in touch either via GitHub or connect@spatialcollective.com if you need any more information.
