# Datasets

In light of recent developments with COVID-19, itâ€™s important we understand what resources are available for people in need during this crisis. This is especially true when it comes to informal settlements. Now more than ever it is important to understand what resources are available, or unavailable, to underserved populations. 

At Spatial Collective, we decided to scan the available data in/on informal settlements, finding what is relevant to the current crisis, including locations of hospitals, water points, and youth groups. Much of the data, while already open and available for use, is unverified and not easily accessible. To make work easier, we have scanned the OpenStreetMap and other data sources, and are working on developing and verifying some of the data sets. This compiled data are available in CSV format and contain a coordinates column (WKT Geometry).

Simply press the download button to get the data sets, and you can get in touch either via GitHub or connect@spatialcollective.com if you need any more information.
